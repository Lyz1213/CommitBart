### Pre-train model checkpoint
We provide our pretrained checkpoint of CommitBART, that is CommitBART-base, and also the CommitBART pretrained without segment embedding CommitBART-unseg. The checkpoint can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1If7knZ9CG1mK_iiC-zaf5HcC2yNffs3R/view?usp=sharing. You can directly load the model's paramters from 'module.bin'.
